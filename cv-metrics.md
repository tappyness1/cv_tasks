This guide assumes a fair understanding of the computer vision-related tasks specifically image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation and their accompanying terms such as bounding boxes and masks. Additionally, it assumes an understanding of classification metrics such as F1 score, precision and recall. 

# Image Classification

Conventional classification metrics can be used to evaluate the 

# Object Detection and Instance Segmentation

## Intersection over Union (IOU)

## Mean Average Precision and Recall

## Thresholds - IOU, Confidence and Non-max Suppression (NMS)

## Frames Per Second
